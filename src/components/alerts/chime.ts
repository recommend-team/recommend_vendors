/**
 * The Recommend chime — two rising notes, synthesised rather than shipped as a file.
 *
 * Synthesised because it is then ours outright: no licence to check, nothing to download
 * or precache, and the same few lines can give the admin panel and the customer app the
 * same sound. It only plays while the app is in front of someone; a backgrounded phone
 * plays its own notification tone and nothing of ours (see NOTIFICATIONS_PLAN.md §1).
 *
 * Browsers refuse audio until the person has interacted with the page, so the audio
 * context is created and resumed on the first tap or key press — `armChime` wires that up
 * once, at startup. A chime requested before then is silently skipped; the banner and the
 * badge still show.
